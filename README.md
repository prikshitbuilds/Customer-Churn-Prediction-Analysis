# 📊 Customer Churn Analysis | Python, SQL

This project focuses on analyzing customer churn for a telecom company using **Python, SQL, and Tableau**.  
The goal was to identify key drivers of churn, build predictive models, and create actionable visualizations to support business decision-making.

---

## 📂 Project Overview
- **Dataset:** Telecom dataset with **7,043 customers**
- **Objective:** Predict churn and uncover insights to help reduce customer attrition
- **Key Deliverables:**
  - Data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory analysis
  - Machine learning models to predict churn
  - Interactive Tableau dashboard for business insights

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming & Analysis:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Machine Learning:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, CatBoost Classifier
- **Database:** SQL (for querying and aggregating customer data)
- **Visualization:** Tableau (interactive dashboard)

---

## 🔎 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Cleaned missing and inconsistent values  
- Analyzed distribution of **contract type, tenure, monthly charges, and churn**  
- Identified strong churn indicators:
  - **Month-to-month contracts**
  - **High monthly charges**
  - **Short tenure (new customers)**

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models
| Model                     | Accuracy |
|----------------------------|----------|
| Logistic Regression        | **82%** |
| Random Forest Classifier   | 84%     |
| CatBoost Classifier        | 86%     |

- Logistic regression provided interpretability of churn factors  
- Ensemble models (Random Forest & CatBoost) improved predictive performance  

---

## 📊 Tableau Dashboard
An interactive dashboard was created to visualize:
- Churn distribution by contract type, tenure, and charges  
- Demographic breakdown of churned customers  
- Retention insights to guide business strategy  

👉 **Impact:** Insights from the dashboard projected to **reduce churn by 15%** through targeted retention strategies.
